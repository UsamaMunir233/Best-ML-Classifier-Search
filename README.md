# Best-ML-Classifier-Search
This repository presents a comprehensive Python-based framework for the comparative analysis of multiple supervised machine learning classification algorithms, all applied to a single, biologically relevant dataset. The input to this framework is a pre-computed similarity matrix, which has been generated using the DG-HGO (Directed Graph of Hybrid Gene Ontology) algorithm developed by Muhammad Asif. This matrix encodes pairwise similarities between data entities—presumably genes or proteins—based on hybrid semantic similarity measures derived from Gene Ontology (GO) terms.

The implemented classification algorithms include:

Random Forest (RF)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Naive Bayes (NB)

XGBoost Classifier (XGB)

Each model is subjected to a comprehensive hyperparameter tuning process using GridSearchCV to identify the most optimal configuration of model-specific parameters. The hyperparameter space is systematically explored for each algorithm, ensuring robust optimization and minimizing the risk of model underperformance due to suboptimal settings.

Performance evaluation is conducted using standard classification metrics, including:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

This framework not only enables the identification of the most effective classification algorithm for a given dataset but also facilitates a quantitative comparison across models, offering valuable insights into their relative strengths and limitations when applied to similarity-based biological data.

The architecture of the codebase is modular and extensible, allowing for the integration of additional models or alternative evaluation metrics as needed. The pipeline serves as a reusable tool for researchers and practitioners engaged in computational biology, bioinformatics, or machine learning, particularly when working with semantic similarity matrices derived from domain-specific knowledge graphs or ontologies.
